# COMP767_BQN_exploration
The project aims to tackle the problem of poor exploration strategies in complex environment by modeling the distribution over Q-value functions using Bayesian Networks

The 3 notebooks correspond to the 3 different environments i.e. Chain, CartPole and Pendulum. Simply running the notebooks should start training the network. Tensorboard can be used to view the plots saved in results folder by tensorboard --logdir results/Cartpole.
